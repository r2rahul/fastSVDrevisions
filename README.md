#### R implementation of Fast Online SVD Revisions for Lightweight Recommender Systems.

The code `increment_svd.R` implements the algorithm of Appendix A of Brand, M paper
 
_Brand, M. “Fast Online SVD Revisions for Lightweight Recommender Systems.” In Proceedings of the 2003 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, 37–46. Proceedings. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2003._

The only R package required is `Matrix`. To test the code simply source `driver_incremental_svd.R`.
